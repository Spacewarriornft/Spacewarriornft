You can then customize your NFT to your liking. Every aesthetic item will have a predetermined limit of MINT. Some items will be even rarer than others. No event series will be repeated once the event is over. The distribution of funds from the sale of cosmetics will be as follows. 50% will be Burn - 25% will go to charity - 20% to the artist - 5% development.</p>

The special farming items will be extremely rare. A really limited amount will be available at the beginning and it will have an extremely rare drop rate afterward. We don't want this to have too much impact on the overall economy of the game. But will be a very good asset for the more daring among you! </p>

It will be possible to get different and additional combat equipment during the daily task and Pvm. It will also be possible to get farming equipment. But these will be extremely rare.

Any other aesthetic or combat equipment will have to be bought or obtained during Daily tasks. It will also be possible to sell or buy combat and costume equipment on the secondary market. It will also be possible to mate the two races together. This will create a race superior to the first two. But there will be a price to pay to create this superior race.

But instead of taking a direct profit. Instead, we will use this method to burn tokens. First, there would be an Nft Farming fee. This fee will then be burned directly. No % will be kept by the team. The battle equipment will have a chance to break. You will then have to use tokens to repair them. These will then be directly burned. There will be cosmetic equipment that will be sold during the year for different events. The cosmetic equipment will only be sold in-game and will have a limited quantity. It can be sold later on the secondary market. The distribution of the profit from the sale of cosmetics will be as follows. 50% will be Burn - 25% will go to charity - 20% to the artist - 5% development. There will also be 10% of the tokens bet during Pvp burned each time. 90% will go to the winner.</p>

This is where the 3rd race will come into play. You will be able to mate 1 female and 1 male from each race together. This will create a superior race. The price paid. One of the 2 NFT will succumb to the mating and will be destroyed forever. You will then find yourself in possession of the superior race and you will still possess one of the original 2 Nft vales. Either the human or the alien. The rate according to which has more chances to survive will be determined by the difference of the 2 populations. If the difference of the Alien is much greater than that of the human. The alien will then be burned. This will not control the population of the 3rd race. The 3rd race will of course be more powerful than the other two. We must then find a solution to control the population of this 3rd race. First of all, it will be impossible to mate this 3rd race together. The only way to get one will be to mate a human and an alien together or to buy them on the secondary market. The burn of this 3rd race will be in the form of Buyback burn. Each month we will buy back a part of this 3rd race at the price floor of the secondary market. This will also have the effect of stimulating the secondary economy. </p>
